# MuphreeTaylor_Orbitrap_Sim_IERs
This is a simulation tool intended to help users estimate the entext of isotpic beating associated mass reporting error for imidazolium IERs only. There are two versions, one that runs a single reporter at a single orbitrap input resolution, and another that runs a group of 5 currently distributed imidazolium IERs at 4 resolutions in batch.
