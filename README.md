# MuphreeTaylor_Orbitrap_Sim_IERs
ORB_sim is a generalizeable simulation intented to caputure isotopic beating effects in orbitrap mass spectra for imidazolium IERs. The 2model_CSE tools are intended to estimate the resolution and deuterium content dependent mass reporting error associated with isotopic beating.
